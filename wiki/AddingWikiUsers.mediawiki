To add a new user to the wiki, they need to have a [https://sourceforge.net/user/registration/ sourceforge account]. Once you know the account name, you can assign editor rights in the [[Special:UserRights]] page. For a list of all users, see [[Special:UserList]]. The '''editor''' right is enough for most users.
