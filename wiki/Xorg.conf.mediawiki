Each device type (stylus, erasor, etc.) needs to be added as a separate InputDevice section and will appear as its own input device in X.

<pre>
Section "InputDevice"
  Driver        "wacom"
  Identifier    "stylus"
  Option        "Device"        "/dev/ttyS0"          # SERIAL ONLY
  Option        "Device"        "/dev/input/wacom"    # USB ONLY
  Option        "Type"          "stylus"
  Option        "USB"           "on"                  # USB ONLY
  Option        "ForceDevice"   "ISDV4"               # Serial Tablet PC ONLY
EndSection

Section "InputDevice"
  Driver        "wacom"
  Identifier    "eraser"
  Option        "Device"        "/dev/ttyS0"          # SERIAL ONLY
  Option        "Device"        "/dev/input/wacom"    # USB ONLY
  Option        "Type"          "eraser"
  Option        "USB"           "on"                  # USB ONLY
  Option        "ForceDevice"   "ISDV4"               # Serial Tablet PC ONLY
EndSection

Section "InputDevice"
  Driver        "wacom"
  Identifier    "cursor"                              # Wacom tablet mouse
  Option        "Device"        "/dev/ttyS0"          # SERIAL ONLY
  Option        "Device"        "/dev/input/wacom"    # USB ONLY
  Option        "Type"          "cursor"
  Option        "USB"           "on"                  # USB ONLY
  Option        "ForceDevice"   "ISDV4"               # Serial Tablet PC ONLY
EndSection

# This section is for Intuos3, Intuos4, CintiqV5, Graphire4, Bamboo, or BambooPT
Section "InputDevice"
  Driver        "wacom"
  Identifier    "pad"                                 # Tablet buttons
  Option        "Device"        "/dev/ttyS0"          # SERIAL ONLY
  Option        "Device"        "/dev/input/wacom"    # USB ONLY
  Option        "Type"          "pad"
  Option        "USB"           "on"                  # USB ONLY
EndSection

# This section is for Tablets & TabletPCs that support touch
Section "InputDevice"
  Driver        "wacom"
  Identifier    "touch"
  Option        "Device"        "/dev/ttyS0"          # SERIAL ONLY
  Option        "Device"        "/dev/input/wacom"    # USB ONLY
  Option        "Type"          "touch"
  Option        "ForceDevice"   "ISDV4"               # Serial Tablet PC ONLY
  Option        "USB"           "on"                  # USB ONLY
EndSection
</pre>

Once the InputDevice sections are present, they need to be referenced from the ServerLayout section to take effect. An example layout section may look like this:
<pre>
Section "ServerLayout"
        Identifier     "X.org Configured"
        InputDevice    "stylus"
        InputDevice    "eraser"
        InputDevice    "cursor"                       # For non-LCD tablets only
	InputDevice    "touch"         # For TabletPCs and BambooPTs that support touch
        InputDevice    "pad"   # For Intuos3/Intuos4/CintiqV5/Graphire4/Bamboo/BambooPT
EndSection
</pre>
