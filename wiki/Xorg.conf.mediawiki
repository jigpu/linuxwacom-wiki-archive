X Servers 1.5 or later (released Sep 3, 2008 [http://lists.x.org/archives/xorg/2008-September/038187.html]) will by default hotplug input devices if they are known to the server's configuration backend ([http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev.html udev] in 1.8 and later, or [http://hal.freedesktop.org HAL]). Manually configuring your tablets by adding them into the <code>xorg.conf</code> file is not reccomended if your X server supports hotplugging, since manually configured tablets loose the ability to be hotplugged. Older X servers, or special-case scenarios not well-handled by hotplugging should follow this guide.

== Example xorg.conf ==
Each device type (stylus, erasor, etc.) needs to be added as a separate InputDevice section and will appear as its own input device in X.

The usb symlinks <code>/dev/input/wacom</code> and <code>/dev/input/wacom-touch</code> will only work if you have the correct wacom.rules file in your distribution's appropriate udev rules.d directory.  See "Updated wacom.c" in [[USB Kernel driver]].

'''NOTE:  <code>Option "ForceDevice" "ISDV4"</code> was deprecated starting with xf86-input-wacom-0.10.8.'''  You can remove it from your xorg.conf sections if using 0.10.8 or later.

{{Tip|text=For older X servers, devices that should also control the cursor need to send core events. To do so, add the following line to the "InputDevice" section of the device.
  Option "SendCoreEvents" "on"
In newer X servers, this option is on by default.

Once the InputDevice sections are present, they need to be referenced from the ServerLayout section to take effect. An example layout section may look like this:

<pre>
Section "ServerLayout"
  Identifier    "X.org Configured"
  InputDevice   "stylus"
  InputDevice   "eraser"
  InputDevice   "cursor"     # For non-LCD tablets only
  InputDevice   "touch"      # For TabletPCs and BambooPTs that support touch
  InputDevice   "pad"        # For Intuos3/Intuos4/CintiqV5/Graphire4/Bamboo/BambooPT
EndSection
</pre>
