== Why linuxwacom and xf86-input-wacom? ==
xf86-input-wacom was created as a fork of linuxwacom for the following reasons:
* linuxwacom has collected some amount of cruft over the years, including some amount of ifdefs that attempt to support every X server version since XFree86-4.
* xf86-input-wacom is an X11-only driver, the kernel driver is not part of xf86-input-wacom.
* Ping has expressed a desire to keep linuxwacom in CVS, in part to avoid disruption for current users of the linuxwacom releases.
* The use of git as SCM should encourage more outside participation, so far  Ping has done most of the heavy lifting in the driver. A more community-driven development model is desirable. We have already seen numerous patches from others and are very happy about this.

xf86-input-wacom is the preferred driver for X Servers 1.7 and later. linuxwacom will <b>not</b> compile against these servers without additional patches.

== Which devices are supported? ==

{{:Supported Devices}}

== How do I configure my device ==

See the [[HOWTO section]].

== How do I get the special features of my stylus to work? ==

There are many different types of styli, mice, and pucks. All of them work to varying degrees, so if you are running into trouble, please send an email to the [[mailing lists]]. Also, if you are having trouble with the stable build of linuxwacom, try the beta. Many of the tools have been recently added and have not yet been moved to the production release.

Note, tilt is only supported with protocol V tablets, which include Intuos series and Cintiq 21UX/20WSX/12WX to date (July. 31, 2009). Any other tablets don't have tilt no matter you have the tilt option in your xorg.conf or not.

== Is hotplug supported for X input devices? ==
Yes, but only for devices configured via HAL. If you have your devices configured in the xorg.conf, you can work around this by switching virtual terminals after replugging your tablet. That is, press Ctrl + Alt + F1 together then release them (screen turns to console); and press Ctrl + Alt + F7 together then release them (screen returns back to normal). On some distributions (e.g. Fedora), the original X session runs on VT1, hence substitute the commands with Ctrl + Alt + F2 and Ctrl + Alt + F1.

== Who is responsible for this code? ==
You are. Linux Wacom is an open source project and driven by Linux users with Wacom tablets such as yourself. John Joganic took up the code in November of 2002 and created this project. The source code was written by at least two dozen individuals, most of them are not directly involved in the project any more. Ping Cheng has assumed the project administrator since 2003. You can help out by testing, reporting bugs, documentation on this wiki and of course by writing patches (see the [[mailing lists]]).
