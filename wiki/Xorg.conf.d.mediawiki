=== xorg.conf.d ===
Static configuration in [[Configuring_X#xorg.conf.d configuration | xorg.conf.d snippets]] applies to hotplugged devices, as opposed to static configuration in the [[Configuring_X#Manual setup in the xorg.conf|xorg.conf]] or runtime configuration with [[xsetwacom]].  
The X server scans several directories for ''.conf'' files on startup:
* ''/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d''
** Files here are the shipped by the distribution and may be overwritten at update time. It is not recommended to place any user-specific configuration files here.
* ''/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d''
** Files here are user-specific configurations. If there is no user-specific configuration, this directory may not exists - simply create it and store your configurations here.
** Files here are read '''after''' the distribution-specific patches, so user-specific configuration always overrides the default configurations.

{{Tip|text=The directories are distribution specific and may vary slightly. Check your Xorg.log for confirmation}}

We will create a new file in /usr/share/X11/ called 52-wacom-options.conf to add configuration Options to.  Numbering it 52 ensures it will be run after the 50-wacom.conf in /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/.
{{Tip|text=Only filenames with the extension .conf are read by the X server.}}

==== X server 1.8 & 1.9 ====
With X servers 1.8 & 1.9 you can only use Options that apply to the parent device (stylus) and not dependent devices like the eraser, cursor, or touch (for serial tablet PCs).  In other words you can only set tablet wide settings.  To configure dependent devices you either have to use xorg.conf sections or xsetwacom commands.

First you will need to determine which snippet your tablet or tablet PC is using.  USB tablets or tablet PCs will use the USB snippet, which we'll use in the following examples.  The N-Trig snippet is self evident.  If your not sure what Serial snippet applies simply comment out the one you think is probably not needed by your serial tablet PC and reboot.  If your digitizer is still working you were right.  The snippet being used by your device is the snippet you need to add your Options to, or to use as the template for the snippet or snippets you will add to your 52-wacom-options.conf.

===== Sample Static Configuration =====
Because you can not configure dependent devices you will just need one snippet, based on the one your device is using.  Notice the ''Driver "wacom"'' line is not needed or included and that the ''Identifier'' has ''options'' added to it.  That allows you to determine at a glance that your match lines worked and your Options are being applied in Xorg.0.log (in /var/log).  Use the standard match line for your snippet, which would be ''MatchProduct "Wacom|WACOM|WALTOP|Hanwang"'' in the USB snippet.

Bamboo Pen & Touch tablets and USB tablet PCs appear to be the exception, but that is an illusion.  That's because they are seen by the system as 2 devices, stylus/eraser & touch/pad for the Bamboo P&T and stylus/eraser & touch for USB tablet PCs.  Because it is the most "complicated" case we will use the Bamboo P&T in the example.  Identify each input tool's "device name" in [[xinput|xinput list]].  Since there are two devices to match, rather than using the standard USB match line, we'll use the ''root'' name for each parent and dependent device.  In the Bamboo P & T case the ''root'' "device names" include ''Pen'' or ''Finger''.

Into your new 52-wacom-options.conf file located in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d to add a ''PressureCurve'' and ''Area'' Options enter:
<pre>
Section "InputClass"
        # This is for human-readable purposes only.
	Identifier "Wacom class options"
        # Match all Wacom input tools that have "BambooFun 2FG 4x5 Pen" in the "device name".
	MatchProduct "Wacom BambooFun 2FG 4x5 Pen"
        # AND match devices with a device path of /dev/input/eventX.
	MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"

        # Apply custom Options to this device below.
	Option "PressCurve" "0 10 90 100"
	Option "TopX" "0"
	Option "TopY" "0"
	Option "BottomX" "14720"
	Option "BottomY" "9200"
EndSection

Section "InputClass"
	Identifier "Wacom class options"
        # Match all Wacom input tools that have "BambooFun 2FG 4x5 Finger" in the "device name".
	MatchProduct "Wacom BambooFun 2FG 4x5 Finger"
	MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"

        # Apply custom Options to this device below.
	Option "TopX" "0"
	Option "TopY" "0"
	Option "BottomX" "480"
	Option "BottomY" "320"
EndSection
</pre>
'''Note''' the static configuration files still use the "old" parameter names.  This demonstrates you can configure Options that apply to both the parent & dependent devices, such as ''PressureCurve'' to stylus/eraser and the ''Area'' coordinates to stylus/eraser & touch.  The ''Area'' coordinates don't affect the pad of course.

==== X server 1.10 ====
With ''X server 1.10'' you can configure dependent devices.  In other words you are able to set each input tool up in its own snippet like a section in the xorg.conf.  The advantage is that these settings will last through a hot plug.  How to do that follows.

===== Sample Dependent Device Static Configuration =====
Again identify each input tool's "device name" in [[xinput|xinput list]].  You'll use each in a match line for it's snippet.  That guarantees specificity and eliminates the need for an extra line to do a generic match to Wacom or whatever.  Plus you can use more than one tablet as long as their "device names" are different, which you can't do using ''eraser'' or ''cursor'', etc.  In each snippet we'll enter the Options equivalent to the xsetwacom parameters used in the [[Tablet Configuration#Sample Runtime Script|Sample Runtime Script]] configuration just as an example.  Notice again the wacom driver line is not used and we modify the Identifier.

Into your new 52-wacom-options.conf file located in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d enter:
<pre>
Section "InputClass"
        # This is for human-readable purposes only.
	Identifier "Wacom class options"
        # Match the Wacom input tool that has this specific "device name".
	MatchProduct "Wacom BambooFun 2FG 4x5 Pen stylus"
        # AND match the device with a device path of /dev/input/eventX.
	MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"

        # Apply custom Options to this device below.
	Option "RawSample" "20"
	Option "PressCurve" "0 10 90 100"
	Option "TopX" "-10"
	Option "TopY" "-20"
	Option "BottomX" "14720"
	Option "BottomY" "9200"
EndSection

        # Apply custom Options to this device below.
	Option "RawSample" "20"
	Option "PressCurve" "5 0 100 95"
