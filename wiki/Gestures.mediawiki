  Gestures for all wacom tablets are not currently supported.  The reason for this is, in order to be supported and be supported decently by a wide range of programs gestures need to be implemented in Xorg itself.
  The issue is if linuxwacom or xf86-input-wacom added gestures then a gesture that might scroll in one program would do a completely different and unwanted action in another program.  While this could be implemented it could possibly create a very large hassle in the end.

For discussion of gestures (and inherently multi-touch) on the Xorg-devel mailing list please see the following threads:
