2-16-11 re:2-15-11 entries Addressed with: **These are a temporary
hack** while we wait on a replacement for wacomcpl, see [Graphical
Configuration
Tools](/wiki/External_applications#Graphical_Configuration_Tools "wikilink").
Addressed issues with: The following scripts were authored by Favux.
Where co-developed with others they are cited in the relevant script.
All or almost all of the values are the defaults with the default stated
and the appropriate range given. The exception being the pad (tablet
buttons). Examples are shown of how to configure those for different
uses in different applications. The scripts are intended to provide you
with a framework to configure your settings in a text file rather than
at the command line, with similar results to what the wacomcpl gui would
have produced.
