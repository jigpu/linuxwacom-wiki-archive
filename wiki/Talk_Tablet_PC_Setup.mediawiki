Why do we have Tablet PC Configuration and Tablet PC Setup?

The thought was that if you did not decide to delete the script pages I would add the individual models to Tablet PC Setup and link them to their sections of Tablet PC Configuration.  They could be merged but I felt that would make Tablet PC Setup unwieldy.  Same applies to Wacom Tablet.  Waltop is the exception because there isn't much variability between models that I can see.


Why is this not part of the Rotation page?

Re: the tablet pc auto-rotation script.  It's a case of general applicability.  The xrandr match line in the tablet pc rotation script has been in use for a little over two years and I presume has been tested by thousands of users.  I base that on the fact the HOW TO it has been posted on has had over 78,000 hits to date.  Provided your video chipset/driver supports rotation it seems to work for everyone.  Given that, and the fact it is a simple "modular" script I felt it belonged in Rotation.

I can only guarantee the tablet pc auto-rotation script works for HP's and Thinkpad's.  I know some other Brand models report tablet state to /etc/acpi-somewhere.  Ubuntu still has a rotation script in there for them.  So I feel confident other tablet pc's could potentially use it.

But I have no objection to moving it to Rotation if desired. - Favux
