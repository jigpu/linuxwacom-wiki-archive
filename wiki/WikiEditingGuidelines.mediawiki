This page lists a set of guidelines for how to edit the wiki to keep it informative and easy-to navigate.

= Use of Categories =
mediawiki has a feature called [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Categories Categories] to group pages. Each page can be part of zero, one or more categories. We currently use the following categories:
* [[:Category:DeveloperPages]]: for anything related to development
* [[:Category:MaintainerPages]]: for anything related to maintainership of the project

If you are adding or editing a page, please make sure it is part of the appropriate category.
