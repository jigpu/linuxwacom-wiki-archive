This page is for general tablet issues & tips as well as model specific issues & tips.

The LWP project welcomes additions to its mediawiki so please join in if you have contributions.

Be aware the Wacom drivers are rapidly evolving and some of this information may become dated.  If so feel free to update and correct the mediawiki.

== Set Up ==
If you have at least the 2.6.35 kernel, particularly the more recent versions, you should be able to get your tablet working on the Wacom driver.  Patches have been submitted by Nikolai Kondrashov to the kernel that should improve Waltop tablet compatibility with the Wacom driver starting in the 2.6.36 or 2.6.37 kernels.  As you know the Waltop tablet is often re-branded and will carry another OEM's name.  To verify that your tablet/stylus is indeed identified as a WALTOP (and to determine the identifier for the match line) enter in a terminal the following.
<pre>
xinput list
</pre>
You should see WALTOP (capitalized) in the tablet/stylus line.  If you see another tablet name in the line you do not have a Waltop.  Use the version of Waltop you see in the match line for the following usb snippet in 50-wacom.conf.  The usb snippet is easy to identify because it has a couple of comment lines discussing Waltops.  Just change the snippet to look like the following.
<pre>
Section "InputClass"
	Identifier "Wacom class"
	MatchProduct "Wacom|WACOM|Hanwang|WALTOP"
	MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
	Driver "wacom"
EndSection
</pre>
And that should be it.  After a reboot your Waltop should now be using the Wacom X driver [[xf86-input-wacom]].  Since it is a system file you need root privileges.  If your system has sudo installed you can use
<pre>
gksudo gedit /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-wacom.conf
</pre>

It's possible additional changes to support your Waltop may have been made since your distribution's default version of [[xf86-input-wacom]].  If your distribution hasn't been updating it you may want to consider cloning it from the git repository.

'''Tip''' If you have problems with both stylus buttons giving the same response despite being set to different values please report your issue to [https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/linuxwacom-discuss linuxwacom-discuss].
