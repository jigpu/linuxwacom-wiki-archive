This page is for general tablet issues & tips as well as model specific issues & tips.

The linuxwacom project welcomes additions to its mediawiki so please join in if you have contributions.

Be aware the Wacom drivers are rapidly evolving and some of this information may become dated.  If so feel free to update and correct the mediawiki.

== Set Up ==
Starting with the 2.6.35 kernel some Waltop tablets were again supported by the Wacom X driver, [[xf86-input-wacom]].   Ongoing work on the kernel continues to add more  Waltop models and improve Waltop support, including compatibility with the Wacom X driver.  Nikolai Kondrashov from the DIGI''mend'' project is involved in much of this work.

Waltop tablets are often re-branded and will carry another OEM's name.  To verify that your tablet/stylus is indeed identified as a WALTOP (and to check the keyword for the match line) enter in a terminal the following.
<pre>
xinput list
</pre>
You should see WALTOP (capitalized) in the tablet/stylus line(s).  If you see another tablet name in the line you do not have a Waltop.

=== 52-waltop.conf ===
To use static options for your tablet's pen place the following snippet in a new file you'll create in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d called '''52-waltop.conf'''.  The snippet should look like the following.
{{Tip|text=A kernel bug in 2.6.35 and 2.6.36 causes both stylus buttons to emit the same button number despite being set to different values. This is fixed in 2.6.37 with backport patches available for 2.6.35 and 2.6.36 on the [http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/digimend/index.php?title=Kernel_patches DIGI''mend'' project] site.}}
<pre>
Section "InputClass"
	Identifier "Waltop pen"
	MatchProduct "WALTOP"
	MatchIsTablet "on"
	MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
	Driver "wacom"
        # Apply custom Options below.

EndSection
</pre>
The MatchIsTablet match is used so only the Waltop's digitizer/stylus is matched, not its pad buttons.  This is because the pad buttons are not supported by xf86-input-wacom and should instead be on xf86-input-evdev.  Since it is a system file you need root privileges.  If your system has gnome and sudo installed you can use:
<pre>
gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/52-waltop.conf
</pre>
You would use whatever text editor and root privilege access your distribution supplies of course.

If your tablet has a multifunction dial (jog wheel) and you would like to enable the scroll function see [http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/digimend/index.php?title=Tablet_setup_with_xf86-input-wacom#52-waltop.conf 52-waltop.conf] on the DIGI''mend'' mediawiki site.

You're using the /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d directory because that is where user specific changes are suppose to go.  The /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d directory is for distribution configuration files and may be overwritten by a distribution update.  Using /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d avoids this possibility.

It's possible additional changes to support your Waltop may have been made since your distribution's default version of xf86-input-wacom.  If your distribution hasn't been updating it you may want to consider cloning it from the git repository.

== Calibration of Your Stylus ==
See the [[Calibration|Calibration HOWTO]].

== Dual and Multi-Monitor Set Up ==
See [[Dual and Multi-Monitor Set Up]].

== Graphical Configuration GUI ==
Several are now available, see [[External applications#Graphical Configuration Tools|Graphical Configuration Tools]].

==  Waltop Tablet Configuration ==
Please see the [[Tablet Configuration|Tablet Configuration HOWTO]].  Just concentrate on the material discussing the stylus, which is fairly brief.

== DIGI''mend'' project ==
Further information on Waltop tablets is available at the [https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/digimend/index.php?title=DIGImend DIGI''mend'' project] site.  This includes Waltop USB kernel driver patches for tablet support on older kernels and using the xf86-input-evdev instead of xf86-input-wacom as the X driver.
