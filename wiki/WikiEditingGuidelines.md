This page lists a set of guidelines for how to edit the wiki to keep it
informative and easy-to navigate.

Use of Categories
=================

mediawiki has a feature called
[Categories](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Categories) to group
pages. Each page can be part of zero, one or more categories. We
currently use the following categories:

-   [Category%3ADeveloperPages](/wiki/Category%3ADeveloperPages "wikilink"):
    for anything related to development
-   [Category%3AMaintainerPages](/wiki/Category%3AMaintainerPages "wikilink"):
    for anything related to maintainership of the project

If you are adding or editing a page, please make sure it is part of the
appropriate category.
