The wacom driver supports rotation by 90 degree angles. The rotation can be
either applied statically (through the [[Configuring X|configuration
files]]) or at runtime (e.g. through [[xsetwacom]]).

The four valid settings are:
* '''none''': the tablet is not rotated in software and uses its natural rotation.
* '''half''': the tablet is rotated by 180 degrees (upside-down)
* '''cw''': the tablet is rotated 90 degrees clockwise
* '''ccw''': the tablet is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise

Note that rotation is tool-specific. If you rotate the stylus tool, the eraser tool and all others still have the original rotation. To rotate the complete tablet, rotate all tools.
