[[Category:HOWTO]]

Please read our [[History]] first for a better understanding of the difference between [[linuxwacom]] and [[xf86-input-wacom]]. We also have a list of [[Supported Devices]]. Distributions usually already ship a version of [[xf86-input-wacom]] in their repositories. Kernel patches for Wacom devices, if they have been submitted upstream, will also usually feed back into your distribution's kernel.

All downloads are available through our [http://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxwacom/files/ Sourceforge page].

{{Tip|text=On modern desktop distributions, you do '''not''' need the kernel or X drivers in the linuxwacom tarball.}}

= Kernel drivers =
* [[input-wacom]], kernel backports for kernels 2.6.30 and 2.6.36:  http://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxwacom/files/xf86-input-wacom/input-wacom/
* [[linuxwacom]], kernel backports for kernels 2.6.16, 2.6.18, 2.6.24, and 2.6.30: http://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxwacom/files/linuxwacom/

= X drivers =
* [[xf86-input-wacom]] for X servers 1.7 and later: http://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxwacom/files/xf86-input-wacom/
* [[linuxwacom]] for X servers up to 1.6: http://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxwacom/files/linuxwacom/
