[[Category:HOWTO]]

For your tablet to work, two pieces are needed: a '''kernel driver''' and a '''X11 driver'''. Please read our [[History]] for a better understanding of the difference between [[xf86-input-wacom]] and the legacy [[linuxwacom]].

{{Tip|text=On modern desktop distributions, you do '''not''' need the kernel or X drivers in the linuxwacom tarball.}}

= Kernel drivers =
Our patches to support Wacom devices are provided upstream to the Linux kernel developers. These changes will usually feed back into your distribution's kernel. We recommend that you first try to update your kernel through your distribution's mechanisms. If you already have the newest kernel available for your distribution, backported kernel drivers are below.

To determine your kernel version, open a terminal and run the following command: <code>uname -r</code>

! Linux Kernel

| 2.6.37 - CURRENT
| Please update through your distribution.
|-
| 2.6.26 - 2.6.36
| [[input-wacom]]
|-
| 2.6.16 - 2.6.25
| [[linuxwacom]]
|}

= X drivers =
Distributions usually already ship a version of the X11 driver in their repositories. We recommend that you first try to update through your distribution's mechanisms. If you require an even more up-to-date version, the latest X11 drivers are below.

To determine your XOrg server version, open a terminal and run the following command: <code>X -version</code>
