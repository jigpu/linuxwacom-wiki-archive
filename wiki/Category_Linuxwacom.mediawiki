This page compiles all information related to the [[linuxwacom]] driver. Note that the [[linuxwacom]] driver is a series of backports for older kernels and X servers and is not part of any modern desktop distribution.  Where ''modern'' is defined as ~kernel 2.6.36 (or later) and X.org X server 1.8 (or later).

<small>The exception being the '''Debian/Ubuntu''' kernel 2.6.32.  Because of their use of a ''hybrid'' X server 1.7 with it, they use the xf86-input-wacom X driver wacom_drv.so and the linuxwacom usb kernel driver/module wacom.ko.</small>
