The Linux Wacom Project
=======================

The Linux Wacom Project manages the drivers, libraries, and
documentation for configuring and running Wacom tablets under the Linux
operating system. It contains diagnostic applications as well as updated
kernel drivers and XFree86/Xorg XInput drivers. Currently, the Linux
Wacom Project provides two packages:

-   [linuxwacom](linuxwacom "wikilink"): a combined package of kernel
    patches and the X11 input driver for X Servers up to including 1.6.
-   [xf86-input-wacom](xf86-input-wacom "wikilink"): the X11 input
    driver for X Servers 1.7 and later
    ([http://who-t.blogspot.com/2009/10/x11r75-released-but-what-is-it.html
    X11R7.5](http://who-t.blogspot.com/2009/10/x11r75-released-but-what-is-it.html_X11R7.5 "wikilink"))

NOTE: A FreeBSD Wacom driver is available through the FreeBSD ports
system. Please email your questions and/or suggestion directly to
Bartosz Fabianowski, the Wacom FreeBSD developer.

### User help

The [HOWTO section](/wiki/HOWTO_section "wikilink") contains step-by-step
instructions for getting your tablet running. If you run into trouble,
let us know so we can get the documentation updated. The most commonly
asked questions and the best answers available to date are in the
[FAQ](/wiki/FAQ "wikilink"). If you still have problem, please check
[Trackers](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=69596) to see if
someone else has reported the issue or has a patch for the problem.

### Mailing lists

The Linux Wacom project provides three mailing lists:

-   [linuxwacom-announce](http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/linuxwacom-announce)
    ([archives](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=linuxwacom-announce))is
    a low-volume mailing list announcing new software releases.
-   [linuxwacom-devel](http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/linuxwacom-devel)
    ([archives](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=linuxwacom-devel))
    is the developer's mailing list. If you have patches for linuxwacom
    or you want to contribute in other ways, please subscribe to this
    list.
-   [linuxwacom-discuss](http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/linuxwacom-discuss)
    ([archives](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=linuxwacom-discuss))

The archives for these lists are also useful for searching problems you
