The Linux Wacom Project
=======================

The Linux Wacom Project manages the drivers, libraries, and
documentation for configuring and running Wacom tablets under the Linux
operating system. It contains diagnostic applications as well as updated
kernel drivers and XFree86/Xorg XInput drivers. Currently, the Linux
Wacom Project provides two packages:

-   [linuxwacom](linuxwacom "wikilink"): a combined package of kernel
    patches and the X11 input driver for X Servers up to including 1.6.
-   [xf86-input-wacom](xf86-input-wacom "wikilink"): the X11 input
    driver for X Servers 1.7 and later
    ([X11R7.5](http://who-t.blogspot.com/2009/10/x11r75-released-but-what-is-it.html))

NOTE: A FreeBSD Wacom driver is available through the
[FreeBSD](http://www.freshports.org/x11-drivers/input-wacom) ports
system. Please email your questions and/or suggestion directly to
[Bartosz Fabianowski](mailto:freebsd@chillt.de?subject=WACOM), the Wacom
FreeBSD developer.
