We switched from the old website to a
[MediaWiki](http://www.mediawiki.org). During the transition period, the
old website is still available
[here](http://linuxwacom.sourceforge.net/index_old.php).

The Linux Wacom Project
=======================

The Linux Wacom Project manages the drivers, libraries, and
documentation for configuring and running Wacom tablets under the Linux
operating system. For your tablet to work, you need two pieces:

-   **kernel drivers:** usually these are included in your distribution
    kernel. If you are required to run a specific kernel, you may need
    to get your kernel patches from the
    [input-wacom](input-wacom "wikilink") or the
    [linuxwacom](linuxwacom "wikilink") package.
-   **[X.Org X11](http://www.x.org) driver:** for most modern
    distributions, you need the
    [xf86-input-wacom](xf86-input-wacom "wikilink") package. If you are
    required to run an [X server of
    1.6](http://who-t.blogspot.com/2009/10/x11r75-released-but-what-is-it.html)
    or earlier, you may need to get your X driver from the
    [linuxwacom](linuxwacom "wikilink") package.

Please read [Wacom Support in
Linux](http://who-t.blogspot.com/2010/09/wacom-support-in-linux.html)
first for a better understanding of the difference between
[linuxwacom](linuxwacom "wikilink") and
[xf86-input-wacom](xf86-input-wacom "wikilink"). We also have a list of
[Supported Devices](/wiki/Supported_Devices "wikilink"). Distributions usually
already ship a version of
[xf86-input-wacom](xf86-input-wacom "wikilink") in their repositories.
Kernel patches for Wacom devices, if they have been submitted upstream,
will also usually feed back into your distribution's kernel.

Downloads
---------

For a list of files available, please visit the
[Downloads](/wiki/Downloads "wikilink") page.

User help
---------

Click **[here](/wiki/Category%3AHOWTO "wikilink")** for a list of **HOWTOs**.

Note that because [linuxwacom](linuxwacom "wikilink") is not necessarily
available in modern distributions anymore, **HOWTOs** and other
information that apply to the [linuxwacom
tarballs](http://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxwacom/files/) are
available separately **[here](/wiki/Category%3ALinuxwacom "wikilink")**. If
you run a modern distribution, you will not need this.

The most commonly asked questions and the best answers available to date
are in the **[FAQ](/wiki/FAQ "wikilink")**. If you still have problem, please
check [Trackers](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=69596) to see
if someone else has reported the issue or has a patch for the problem.

Mailing lists
-------------

IRC
---

The official linuxwacom [IRC](/wiki/IRC "wikilink") channel is
**\#linuxwacom** on **irc.freenode.net**. It is recommended if you ask
questions there that you also ask them on the mailing list. Please be
patient if you ask a question on IRC. People are not always watching the
channel.
