The Linux Wacom Project
=======================

The Linux Wacom Project manages the drivers, libraries, and
documentation for configuring and running Wacom tablets under the Linux
operating system. It contains diagnostic applications as well as updated
kernel drivers and XFree86/Xorg XInput drivers. Currently, the Linux
Wacom Project provides two packages:

-   [linuxwacom](linuxwacom "wikilink"): a combined package of kernel
    patches and the X11 input driver for X Servers up to including 1.6.
-   [xf86-input-wacom](xf86-input-wacom "wikilink"): the X11 input
    driver for X Servers 1.7 and later
    ([X11R7.5](http://who-t.blogspot.com/2009/10/x11r75-released-but-what-is-it.html))

Please read [Wacom Support in
Linux](http://who-t.blogspot.com/2010/09/wacom-support-in-linux.html)
first for a better understanding of the difference between
[linuxwacom](linuxwacom "wikilink") and
[xf86-input-wacom](xf86-input-wacom "wikilink").

NOTE: A FreeBSD Wacom driver is available through the
[FreeBSD](http://www.freshports.org/x11-drivers/input-wacom) ports
system. Please email your questions and/or suggestion directly to
[Bartosz Fabianowski](mailto:freebsd@chillt.de?subject=WACOM), the Wacom
FreeBSD developer.

User help
---------

The [HOWTO](/wiki/HOWTO "wikilink") contains step-by-step instructions for
getting your tablet running. If you run into trouble, let us know so we
can get the documentation updated. The most commonly asked questions and
the best answers available to date are in the [FAQ](/wiki/FAQ "wikilink"). If
you still have problem, please check

someone else has reported the issue or has a patch for the problem.
