= The Linux Wacom Project =

The Linux Wacom Project manages the drivers, libraries, and documentation for configuring and running Wacom tablets under the Linux operating system. It contains diagnostic applications as well as updated kernel drivers and XFree86/Xorg XInput drivers. 


NOTE: A FreeBSD Wacom driver is available through the FreeBSD ports system. Please email your questions and/or suggestion directly to Bartosz Fabianowski, the Wacom FreeBSD developer.

=== User help ===
The [[HOWTO section]] contains step-by-step instructions for getting your tablet running. If you run into trouble, let us know so we can get the documentation updated.
The most commonly asked questions and the best answers available to date are in the [[FAQ]]. If you still have problem, please check [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=69596 Trackers] to see if someone else has reported the issue or has a patch for the problem.
