= The Linux Wacom Project =

The Linux Wacom Project manages the drivers, libraries, and documentation for configuring and running Wacom tablets under the Linux operating system. It contains diagnostic applications as well as updated kernel drivers and XFree86/Xorg XInput drivers. Currently, the Linux Wacom Project provides two packages:

* [[linuxwacom]]: a combined package of kernel patches and the X11 input driver for X Servers up to including 1.6.
* [[xf86-input-wacom]]: the X11 input driver for X Servers 1.7 and later ([http://who-t.blogspot.com/2009/10/x11r75-released-but-what-is-it.html X11R7.5])

{{:Supported Devices}}

NOTE: A FreeBSD Wacom driver is available through the [http://www.freshports.org/x11-drivers/input-wacom FreeBSD] ports system. Please email your questions and/or suggestion directly to [mailto:freebsd@chillt.de?subject=WACOM Bartosz Fabianowski], the Wacom FreeBSD developer.
