{{Tip|text=On modern desktop distributions, you do '''not''' need the kernel or X drivers in the linuxwacom tarball.}}

The Linux Wacom Project manages the drivers, libraries, and documentation for configuring and running Wacom tablets under the Linux operating system.
For your tablet to work, you need two pieces:
* '''kernel drivers:''' usually these are included in your distribution kernel. If you are required to run a specific kernel, you may need to get your kernel patches from the [[input-wacom]] or the [[linuxwacom]] package.
* '''[http://www.x.org X.Org X11] driver:''' for most modern distributions, you need the [[xf86-input-wacom]] package. If you are required to run an [http://who-t.blogspot.com/2009/10/x11r75-released-but-what-is-it.html X server of 1.6] or earlier, you may need to get your X driver from the [[linuxwacom]] package.

Please read [http://who-t.blogspot.com/2010/09/wacom-support-in-linux.html Wacom Support in Linux] first for a better understanding of the difference between [[linuxwacom]] and [[xf86-input-wacom]]. We also have a list of [[Supported Devices]]. Distributions usually already ship a version of [[xf86-input-wacom]] in their repositories. Kernel patches for Wacom devices, if they have been submitted upstream, will also usually feed back into your distribution's kernel.

== User help ==
Click '''[[:Category:HOWTO|here]]''' for a list of '''HOWTOs'''.

Note that because [[linuxwacom]] is not necessarily available in modern distributions anymore, '''HOWTOs''' and other information that apply to the [http://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxwacom/files/ linuxwacom tarballs] are available separately '''[[:Category:Linuxwacom|here]]'''. If you run a modern distribution, you will not need this.

The most commonly asked questions and the best answers available to date are in the '''[[FAQ]]'''. If you still have problem, please check [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=69596 Trackers] to see if someone else has reported the issue or has a patch for the problem.

== IRC ==
The official linuxwacom [[IRC]] channel is '''#linuxwacom''' on '''irc.freenode.net'''.  It is recommended if you ask questions there that you also ask them on the mailing list.  Please be patient if you ask a question on IRC.  People are not always watching the channel.
