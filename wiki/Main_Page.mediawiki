= The Linux Wacom Project =

The Linux Wacom Project manages the drivers, libraries, and documentation for configuring and running Wacom tablets under the Linux operating system. It contains diagnostic applications as well as updated kernel drivers and [http://www.xfree86.org XFree86]/[http://www.x.org X.Org] X input drivers. Currently, the Linux Wacom Project provides two packages:

* [[linuxwacom]]: a combined package of kernel patches (backports!) and the X11 input driver for X Servers up to including 1.6.
* [[xf86-input-wacom]]: the X11 input driver for X Servers 1.7 and later ([http://who-t.blogspot.com/2009/10/x11r75-released-but-what-is-it.html X11R7.5])

Please read [http://who-t.blogspot.com/2010/09/wacom-support-in-linux.html Wacom Support in Linux] first for a better understanding of the difference between [[linuxwacom]] and [[xf86-input-wacom]]. We also have a list of [[Supported Devices]].

=== So, what do I need? ===
On most desktop distributions, you need [[xf86-input-wacom]] as your X driver. Note that distributions usually already ship a version of xf86-input-wacom in their repositories. Kernel patches for Wacom devices, if they have been submitted upstream, will also likely be available in your distribution's kernel.

If your device is not supported by the current kernel and no Wacom patches are pending, you may be lucky with the [[linuxwacom]] kernel patches. Note that these apply outside of your distribution and you will need to re-install each time you update your distribution kernel.

== User help ==
The [[HOWTO]] contains step-by-step instructions for getting your tablet running. If you run into trouble, let us know so we can get the documentation updated.
The most commonly asked questions and the best answers available to date are in the [[FAQ]]. If you still have problem, please check [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=69596 Trackers] to see if someone else has reported the issue or has a patch for the problem.
