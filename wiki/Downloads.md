Please read our [History](/wiki/History "wikilink") first for a better
understanding of the difference between
[linuxwacom](linuxwacom "wikilink") and
[xf86-input-wacom](xf86-input-wacom "wikilink"). We also have a list of
[Supported Devices](/wiki/Supported_Devices "wikilink"). Distributions usually
already ship a version of
[xf86-input-wacom](xf86-input-wacom "wikilink") in their repositories.
Kernel patches for Wacom devices, if they have been submitted upstream,
will also usually feed back into your distribution's kernel.

All downloads are available through our [Sourceforge
page](http://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxwacom/files/).
