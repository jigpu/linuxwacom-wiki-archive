'''In Progress'''

This page shows you how to assemble a runtime or static configuration for a specific tablet or tablet PC model.  Additionally it demonstrates how to create profiles for various applications.

The linuxwacom project welcomes additions to its mediawiki so please join in if you have contributions.

Currently [[xf86-input-wacom]] does not have a configuration gui like linuxwacom's Wacom Control Panel (wacomcpl).  However since '''wacomcpl''' stored its settings as a [[xsetwacom]] script in '''.xinitrc''' you can essentially duplicate the .xinitrc, calling it say '''.xsetwacom.sh'''.  '''This can be considered a work around''' while waiting for the development of a Tablet Configuration GUI, see [[External applications#Graphical Configuration Tools|Graphical Configuration Tools]].

It should be relatively straight forward to assemble a configuration script for your tablet.  Be sure to read ''man wacom'', ''man xsetwacom'', [[Xsetwacom]], and enter ''xsetwacom list parameters''in a terminal to learn about the parameters or Options you may want to change.  As you will see a script can give you some finer control over your tablet's features and also let you create profiles.

'''Note:''' Be aware that the xsetwacom interface may change without notice.  If this happens feel free to update and correct this linux wacom project mediawiki page.

If a xsetwacom command stops working your friend is the get command.

{{Warning|reason=With the advent of [https://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxwacom/files/xf86-input-wacom/ xf86-input-wacom-10.11] many of the xsetwacom parameter names have changed.  See [[Xsetwacom#Table of New Parameter Names|Table of New Parameter Names]]}}

The sections below demonstrate a sample of the various tablets with tablet buttons or a ''pad''.  They are ordered to somewhat mimic the physical layout of the various pads.  Enter ''xsetwacom list modifiers'' in a console to see the modifiers and special keys available.

==== Bamboo Pen & Touch ====
The following button values or assignments are the defaults.
<pre>
xsetwacom set "Wacom BambooFun 2FG 4x5 Finger pad" Button 1 1
xsetwacom set "Wacom BambooFun 2FG 4x5 Finger pad" Button 2 2

=== Sample Runtime Script ===
Now say I have a Bamboo Pen and Touch tablet and I want to write a runtime script for it.  I want to change the PressureCurve for the stylus and eraser, using a softer one for the stylus and a firmer one for the eraser.  Also I have the GTK CPU utilization bug in Gimp so I want to adjust RawSample up to decrease the lag between where the stylus tip is and when the line is drawn in Gimp.  On top of all  that I noticed the stylus wasn't quite reaching the top and left screen edges so after [[Calibration|calibrating]] I have some new tablet area values I want to use.  I'm a pretty quick double tapper who drinks a little too much caffeine and I want to decrease my TapTime a little.  Plus I want my scrolling a little more sensitive.  And I want my pad (tablet buttons) to have the default Windows XP setup, just because.

I need to obtain my "device names" by running the [[xinput|xinput  list]] command in a terminal.  Now I can proceed to assemble the following shell script.
<pre>
#!/bin/sh

## Stylus
xsetwacom set "Wacom BambooFun 2FG 4x5 Pen stylus" RawSample 20
xsetwacom set "Wacom BambooFun 2FG 4x5 Pen stylus" PressureCurve 0 10 90 100
xsetwacom set "Wacom BambooFun 2FG 4x5 Pen stylus" Area -10 -20 14720 9200

## Eraser
xsetwacom set "Wacom BambooFun 2FG 4x5 Pen eraser" RawSample 20
xsetwacom set "Wacom BambooFun 2FG 4x5 Pen eraser" PressureCurve 5 0 100 95
xsetwacom set "Wacom BambooFun 2FG 4x5 Pen eraser" Area -10 -20 14720 9200

## Touch (2FGT)
xsetwacom set "Wacom BambooFun 2FG 4x5 Finger touch" ScrollDistance 18
xsetwacom set "Wacom BambooFun 2FG 4x5 Finger touch" TapTime 220

## Pad
xsetwacom set "Wacom BambooFun 2FG 4x5 Finger pad" Button 1 "key ctrl t"  # key combination for toggle touch script
xsetwacom set "Wacom BambooFun 2FG 4x5 Finger pad" Button 2 "key backspace"
xsetwacom set "Wacom BambooFun 2FG 4x5 Finger pad" Button 3 3  # right mouse click
xsetwacom set "Wacom BambooFun 2FG 4x5 Finger pad" Button 4 1  # left mouse click
</pre>

=== Setting Up the Script to Run at Startup ===
Now I want my new shell script configuration to apply even after a restart.  While you can change your settings on the fly using xsetwacom commands in a terminal, because they are runtime commands they only apply during the current session.  So you need to set a xsetwacom script to auto-start.  Create a file and enter the contents of the script you want into it.  Name it .xsetwacom.sh (or whatever you prefer).

Place the script in a file called bin/.xsetwacom.sh in your home directory.  You may need to create the bin directory in /home/yourusername/ first.  Many distributions recommend placing user binaries and scripts in a user /bin directory rather than just in /home/yourusername/.  Make the script executable with:

  chmod +x $HOME/bin/.xsetwacom.sh

The . in front of xsetwacom makes it a hidden file.  You don't have to do that although it helps prevent directory clutter.  Then in Gnome go to System > Preferences > Startup Applications (or your distribution's equivalent) and click on Add and for the command write "sh /home/yourusername/bin/.xsetwacom.sh" (without the quotes).

=== Profiles ===
A ''Profile'' contains the settings you prefer for an individual program you use your tablet in.  Usually it consists of modifying the pad button assignments but can also involve changing the PressureCurve or Stylus button assignment or whatever else is useful for a given program.  To select different pad button assignments you should become familiar with the keyboard shortcuts available in the program you are interested in.  For e.g. with Gimp look in ''Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts'' or ''Edit > Preferences > Interface > Configure Keyboard Shortcuts''.  For Inkscape it's ''Help > Keys and Mouse reference'' which takes you to the keyboard shortcuts online.  Some of the pad sections above contained possible Gimp and Inkscape button assignments.

So let's write a Gimp profile for a Bamboo Pen and Touch tablet.

==== Launcher for Profile ====

== Static (xorg.conf.d or xorg.conf) Configuration ==
Entering ''man wacom'' in a terminal will bring up the Options you can enter into [[Configuring X|/etc/udev/X11/52-wacom-options.conf]] or in the xorg.conf.
