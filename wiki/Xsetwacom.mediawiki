xsetwacom is a commandline utility to change wacom driver settings at runtime. This includes direct settings of driver properties but also several 'indirect' settings (i.e. the xsetwacom command does not relate directly to a single property). For a detailed description of xsetwacom's commands and options, please refer to the man page. This page provides a general overview and describes some of the [[#Quirks|quirks]] you may encounter.

Note that any setting changed by xsetwacom will be reset to default (or a
[[Configuring X|statically configured setting]]) whenever the device is
unplugged, disabled or the X Server is restarted.

'''A note to developers: do not rely on xsetwacom, as it's UI will change without warning.'''

= Usage =
To list the applicable devices. 
  xsetwacom list

Which produces output similar to this:
<pre>
$> xsetwacom list
Wacom Intuos4 6x9 eraser        	id: 12	type: ERASER    
Wacom Intuos4 6x9 cursor        	id: 13	type: CURSOR    
Wacom Intuos4 6x9 pad           	id: 14	type: PAD       
Wacom Intuos4 6x9 stylus        	id: 15	type: STYLUS    
</pre>
On the left is the device name, used as parameter in all other xsetwacom commands. The device ID and device type is provided as well.


The usual invocation to get a parameter is:
  xsetwacom get "Wacom Intuos4 6x9 stylus" Button1

Replace the device name with the one applicable in your case. This will print the current value of the parameter, in this case the current mapping for button 1.
  xsetwacom set "Wacom Intuos4 6x9 stylus" Button1 3
sets the button 1 to logical button 3 - a right click. Note that parameters are per-tool and you will need to set the parameter for each tool if you want them to apply tablet-wide.

Finally, to get a list of parameters just type
  xsetwacom list param
