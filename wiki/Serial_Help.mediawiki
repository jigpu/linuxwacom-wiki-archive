=== Woe Not Serial Woes ===

This page is an effort to help aid you in setting up your serial tablet by braking down the main problem areas. With some
time and patients, you should be able to apply the appropriate changes in order to make use of your Wacom serial device.

=== Serial Woes Check List ===

We have a few situations that can arise when trouble shooting a serial tablet.
# The serial port has not been identified and set to the appropriate uart and irq values of your serial hardware.
# The serial port has been assigned to another program, interfering with the tablet signals
# The older wacom driver that supports serial tablets is incompatible with the X server you are running
# You are running X server 1.7 or later with the xf86-input-wacom driver which does not support serial tablets at the moment.
