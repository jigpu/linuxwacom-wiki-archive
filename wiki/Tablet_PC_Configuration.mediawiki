{{Unclear|reason=
* Having model-specific scripts like .xsetwacom.sh is a temporary hack and needs to be stated as such}}

This page is for Brand & model specific configuration issues & tips.

The linuxwacom project welcomes additions to its mediawiki so please join in if you have contributions.

Currently [[xf86-input-wacom]] does not have a configuration gui like linuxwacom's Wacom Control Panel (wacomcpl).  However since '''wacomcpl''' stored its settings as a [[xsetwacom]] script in '''.xinitrc''' we can at least duplicate the .xinitrc, calling it say '''.xsetwacom.sh'''.  Below is a set of sample scripts for various tablet pc's.  If yours is not among them noticed there is a high degree of overlap.  They're all Wacom tablet pc's after all.  So it should be relatively straight forward to assemble one for your tablet pc.

While doing things this way may seem a little strange at first you'll find yourself quickly adapting.  And this allows you some of the finer control over your tablet's features wacomcpl gave you.

'''Note''' While these xsetwacom commands were working as of 2-1-11 be aware that the xsetwacom interface may change without notice.  If this happens feel free to update and correct this LWP mediawiki page.

If a xsetwacom command stops working your friend is the get command.

== Installing the Script ==
While you can change your settings on the fly using xsetwacom commands in a terminal they only apply during the current session.  So you need to set it up to auto-start.  Create a file and copy & paste the contents of the script you want into it.  Rename it .xsetwacom.sh (or whatever you want) and place it in your home directory. Remember it will be a hidden file because of the . in front. To enable the xsetwacom commands in the .xsetwacom.sh file to apply to Xserver through a reboot you enter in a terminal.
<pre>
chmod +x ~/.xsetwacom.sh
</pre>
Or you could right click on the file and in Properties, in the Permission tab, check Execute as program. Then go to System->Preferences->Startup Applications (or your distributions equivalent) and click on Add and for the command write "sh /home/yourusername/.xsetwacom.sh" (without the quotes).

Once the script is executable you can double click on it to apply it's settings or reboot to check the auto-start set up.

== The Sample Xsetwacom Scripts ==
{{Warning|reason=These scripts below have not been reviewed by our developers and should be used with care}}

{{Unclear|reason=
* Who wrote these scripts? They need to be reviewed by the developers to fix up the coding
* What values differ from the defaults? And why can't we make those values defaults upstream?
}}

In the example scripts below both "Device name" and ID # are used. Be sure to check for yours using 'xinput  list' (without the quotes) in a terminal and use them. When you use a xorg.conf the "Device names" will be stylus, eraser, touch, and pad. If you are hot plugging other devices into your tablet pc be sure to use "Device name" as the ID # can change.
