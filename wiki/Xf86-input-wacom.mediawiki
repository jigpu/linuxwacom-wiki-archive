The '''xf86-input-wacom''' driver provides desktop support for Wacom tablets, touchscreens, and similar hardware. It is responsible for relaying events from the kernel to the X server where applications like GIMP, Krita, and Xournal can make use of them. Additionally, it provides services like palm rejection that improve the experience of using a tablet.

== Get the Drivers ==
The easiest (and recomended) way to get support for Wacom hardware is to install the packages provided by your distribution. Our drivers are provided out of the box with most distributions, but can be updated or installed with the following commands:

{|
|-
! Fedora, Red Hat, Mageia
| <code>$ sudo -s 'yum makecache && yum install xorg-x11-drv-wacom'</code>
|- 
! style="background:#E8EFF8" | Ubuntu, Mint, Debian
| style="background:#E8EFF8" | <code>$ sudo -s 'apt-get update && apt-get install xserver-xorg-input-wacom'</code>
|-
! SUSE
| <code>$ sudo -s 'zypper update && zypper install xf86-input-wacom'</code>
|-
! style="background:#E8EFF8" | Arch Linux
| style="background:#E8EFF8" | <code>$ sudo -s 'pacman -Sy && pacman -S xf86-input-wacom'</code>
|-
! Gentoo
| <code>$ sudo -s 'emerge --sync && emerge xf86-input-wacom'</code>
|}

== Building from Source ==
There is also the option of building and installing the driver from source. Before doing so, you'll need to install a number of build dependencies. Use the appropriate command below.
{{Tip|text=Developers cloning from git will want to also install the 'git', 'automake', and 'autoconf' packages.}}
{|
|-
! Fedora, Red Hat, Mageia
| <code>$ sudo yum install gcc xorg-x11-util-macros xorg-x11-server-devel libXext-devel libXi-devel libXrandr-devel libXinerama-devel libudev-devel</code>
|- 
! style="background:#E8EFF8" | Ubuntu, Mint, Debian
| style="background:#E8EFF8" | <code>$ sudo apt-get install pkg-config make xutils-dev libtool xserver-xorg-dev libx11-dev libxi-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libudev-dev</code>
|}

{{Tip|text=Developers also have the option of building from git by running <code>git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/linuxwacom/xf86-input-wacom</code>. After checking out, you should run <code>./automake.sh</code> to create the configure script and then run the commands found to the left to configure, build, and install.}}

With all the build dependencies installed, you should now [https://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxwacom/files/latest/download download the latest xf86-input-wacom release] and extract it to a convenient location. Open a terminal, and navigate to the directory you extracted. If you were instructed to apply a patch file for testing purposes, download it, move it into the current directory, and run <code>patch -p1 < <patchfile></code> (replacing "<patchfile>" with the name of the downloaded patch file).

At this point, you should run the following commands to configure, build, and install the driver:
<pre>
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
$ make
$ sudo make install
</pre>

== Post-Install ==
After installing the driver, you'll need to restart the driver by logging out. In addition, it may be necessary to configure X before you can use your tablet. See the [[configuring X]] page for more information.
