== Bamboo Pen & Touch ==
In October of 2009 Wacom released a new series of 5 tablets we'll call generically the Bamboo Pen & Touch's.  The Bamboo Pen had a stylus (with no eraser), the Bamboo Touch had 2FG touch only, and the Bamboo Pen & Touch's came with a stylus/eraser and touch(2FG)/pad(4 tablet buttons).  This was followed in October of 2010 by the release of 5 new Bamboo Pen & Touch's with two of them being "Special Editions" with 4FGT.

To determine your product ID enter in a terminal 'lsusb' and look in the Wacom line.  The first 5 models are the 0xD0, 0xD1, 0xD2, 0xD3, & 0xD4.  The new models are the 0xD6, 0xD7, 0xD8, 0xDA, & 0xDB.  See [[Device IDs]].

=== Set Up ===
Depending on your distribution's kernel the 5 original models may not be recognized because the default wacom.ko with the kernel may not have the models in it.  If your distribution has not backported support and has no plans to you can use the linuxwacom-0.8.8-10's wacom.ko as it does have the models in it.  See [[Linuxwacom]].  The wacom.ko will be created after the ./configure line, no need for the 'make && sudo make install' line.  Just copy it into place.
<pre>
sudo cp ./src/2.6.30/wacom.ko /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/input/tablet/wacom.ko
</pre>
Rebuild all of the module dependencies before rebooting with.
<pre>
depmod -a
</pre>

The newer 5 models can either be manually added to linuxwacom's wacom_wac.c in the source code before compiling or you could use [[input-wacom]]-0.10.10-1, which already has the models added.

To get a X driver for all 10 models you can clone the [[xf86-input-wacom]] git repository.  All 10 models have been added to xf86-input-wacom-0.10.10+ as of January 21, 2011.

=== BambooPT Touch Toggle Script ===
The following script depends on the [[xsetwacom]] get and set commands.  The "Device name" for touch is found by using 'xinput list' as mentioned in the script comments. 
<pre>
#!/bin/bash

## Get the "Device name" or ID number
## for touch from 'xinput list'.

TOUCH_STATE=`xsetwacom get "Wacom BambooFun 2FG 4x5 Finger touch" touch`
if [ "$TOUCH_STATE" == "on" ]
  then
    echo "Touch is ON, turning OFF."
    xsetwacom set "Wacom BambooFun 2FG 4x5 Finger touch" touch off
  else
    echo "Touch is OFF, turning ON."
    xsetwacom set "Wacom BambooFun 2FG 4x5 Finger touch" touch on
fi
</pre>
Place the script in a file called .toggle-touch.sh (or whatever you want) and place it in your home directory. Remember it will be a hidden file because of the . in front. Also please remember you have to chmod it to make it executable, or right click on it and make it executable through Properties. Then you have to make a key binding for it in order to assign it to a tablet button. One way to do that is to install the CompizConfig Settings Manager (if you haven't already).
*click on the General option
*click on Commands
*in Command line 0 (or whatever line you want) add the path to .toggle-touch.sh, e.g.: /home/yourusername/.toggle-touch.sh
*click on Key Bindings and then to edit the corresponding Run command 0 click on the Disabled button.
*next use a key combination not already in use, e.g. <Control>t, by pressing the Grab key combination button and pressing the key combination. The ctrl-t combination is the one in the sample xsetwacom script bound to Button1. You can also just press ctrl-t.  If you use 'ctrl t' to add a new Tab to Firefox change the touch toggle key combination to say "key ctrl shift t".
*assign it to a tablet button
<pre>
xsetwacom set "Wacom BambooFun 2FG 4x5 Finger touch" Button1 "key ctrl t"  # toggle touch script
</pre>
*you're done


'''Tip''' If you are using a xorg.conf the symlink for the Bamboo P&T pad is wacom-touch not wacom.

'''Tip''' No one has yet reported trying a stylus with an eraser on the Bamboo Pen that I'm aware of.  If anyone has and the eraser works please notify us at [https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/linuxwacom-discuss linuxwacom-discuss].

== Intuos4 ==

=== Intuos4 Wireless ===
Unfortunately the Intuos 4 Wireless is not currently supported by the Bluez stack.  It is not simply a matter of adding the Vendor ID 0x56a and Product ID 0xBD alongside the Graphire Bluetooth Wireless' 0x56a & 0x81.  This is because the Graphire Bluetooth Wireless is a Protocol 4 device (tool serial numbers are not reported) while the Intuos 4 Wireless is Protocol 5 (serial numbers reported).  So code for Protocol 5 support needs to be added to the Bluez stack.  In the meantime you will need to use your usb "charging" cable for your tablet to work in linux.

=== OLED's ===
