== Bamboo Pen & Touch ==
In October of 2009 Wacom released a new series of 5 tablets we'll call generically the Bamboo Pen & Touch's.  The Bamboo Pen had a stylus (with no eraser), the Bamboo Touch had 2FG touch only, and the Bamboo Pen & Touch's came with a stylus/eraser and touch(2FG)/pad(4 tablet buttons).  This was followed in October of 2010 by the release of 5 new Bamboo Pen & Touch's with two of them being "Special Editions" with 4FGT.

To determine your product ID enter in a terminal 'lsusb' and look in the Wacom line.  The first 5 models are the 0xD0, 0xD1, 0xD2, 0xD3, & 0xD4.  The new models are the 0xD6, 0xD7, 0xD8, 0xDA, & 0xDB.  See [[Device IDs]].

=== Setup ===
{{Unclear|reason=* do not re-write compilation instructions here, instead, link to linuxwacom kernel compilation page
* recommending that users install out-of-tree kernel patches is not a good idea}}
Depending on your distribution's kernel the 5 original models may not be recognized because the default wacom.ko with the kernel may not have the models in it.  If your distribution has not backported support and has no plans to you can use the linuxwacom-0.8.8-10's wacom.ko as it does have the models in it.  See [[Linuxwacom]].  The wacom.ko will be created after the ./configure line, no need for the 'make && sudo make install' line.  Just copy it into place.
<pre>
sudo cp ./src/2.6.30/wacom.ko /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/input/tablet/wacom.ko
</pre>
Rebuild all of the module dependencies before rebooting with.
<pre>
depmod -a
</pre>

{{Unclear|reason=* this is a HOWTO. do not recommend users hack the kernel patches. if they don't have appropriate kernels, they have to wait, or refer them to the developer pages}}

The newer 5 models can either be manually added to linuxwacom's wacom_wac.c in the source code before compiling or you could use [[input-wacom]]-0.10.10-1, which already has the models added.

All 10 models have been added to [[xf86-input-wacom|xf86-input-wacom-0.10.10 and later]] as of January 21, 2011.

=== Bamboo P&T Touch Toggle Script ===
Turning touch off helps to avoid accidental input if you touch the tablet when not holding the stylus (it alsoduplicates the function and button assignment in Windows).

The following script requires [[xsetwacom]].  The device name for touch is found by using ''xsetwacom list dev'' as mentioned in the script comments. 
<pre>
#!/bin/bash

## Get the "Device name" or ID number
## for touch from 'xsetwacom list dev'

DEVICE="Wacom BambooFun 2FG 4x5 Finger touch" 
TOUCH_STATE=`xsetwacom get "$DEVICE" touch`
if [ "$TOUCH_STATE" == "on" ]
  then
    echo "Touch is ON, turning OFF."
    xsetwacom set "$DEVICE" touch off
  else
    echo "Touch is OFF, turning ON."
    xsetwacom set "$DEVICE" touch on
fi
</pre>
Place the script in a file called ''bin/toggle-touch.sh'' in your home directory. Make the script executable with ''chmod +x $HOME/bin/toggle-touch.sh''. Then you have to make a key binding for it in order to assign it to a tablet button. This depends on your window manager.

=== Compiz ===
If your window manager is compiz, install the CompizConfig Settings Manager (if you haven't already).

We are attempting the following setup: when you press button 1, you toggle between touch on or off.

The setup for this is a bit roundabout though:
* configure the tablet to send a key combination when button 1 is pressed.
* the key combination triggers the window manager to run the script above
* the script then toggles the button

In the configuration example below, we will use button 1 and the key combination of Ctrl+T. If you chose a different button or key combination, replace the occurances accordingly.

To configure all this, do the following:

* first, configure the tablet to send the key combination
<pre>
xsetwacom set "Wacom BambooFun 2FG 4x5 Finger touch" Button1 "key ctrl t"
</pre>
* then, in the CompizConfig Settings Manager, click on the General option
* click on Commands
* in Command line 0 (or whatever line you want) add the path to toggle-touch.sh, e.g.: ''/home/yourusername/bin/toggle-touch.sh''
* click on Key Bindings and then to edit the corresponding Run command 0 click on the Disabled button.
* press the Grab key combination button and then press the key combination
* tablet button 1 should now toggle the touch between on and off


{{Tip|text=If you are using a xorg.conf the symlink for the Bamboo P&T pad is wacom-touch not wacom.}}

'''Tip''' No one has yet reported trying a stylus with an eraser on the Bamboo Pen that I'm aware of.  If anyone has and the eraser works please notify us at [https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/linuxwacom-discuss linuxwacom-discuss].

== Intuos4 ==

=== Intuos4 Wireless ===
Unfortunately the Intuos 4 Wireless is not currently supported by the Bluez stack.  It is not simply a matter of adding the Vendor ID 0x56a and Product ID 0xBD alongside the Graphire Bluetooth Wireless' 0x56a & 0x81.  This is because the Graphire Bluetooth Wireless is a Protocol 4 device (tool serial numbers are not reported) while the Intuos 4 Wireless is Protocol 5 (serial numbers reported).  So code for Protocol 5 support needs to be added to the Bluez stack.  In the meantime you will need to use your usb "charging" cable for your tablet to work in linux.

=== OLED's ===
