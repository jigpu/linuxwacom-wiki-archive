May make more sense to make the snippet being used in the Configuration
HOWTOs a template and add the template to Xsetwacom and the
Configuration HOWTOs. That way edits to the snippet template would apply
to all four HOWTOs rather than use <noinclude> and </noinclude> in
Xsetwacom. Thoughts? - Favux
