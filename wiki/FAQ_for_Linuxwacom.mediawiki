'''This FAQ is intended only for questions relating to the linuxwacom drivers on legacy systems''' not dealt with by the LWP's [[FAQ]].  It is not intended to replace or duplicate '''the LWP's [[FAQ]].  Check there first''' for answers to your questions.

The Linuxwacom FAQ is based on the questions that we receive in email. If you have a question that is not answered on the LWP FAQ or here, send your email directly to the [[Main Page#Mailing lists|mailing list]].



== How do I get the special features of my stylus to work? ==
See the LWP's [[FAQ#How do I get the special features of my stylus to work?|FAQ]]

== I keep losing my wacomcpl (.xinitrc) settings.  What can I do? ==
If you are losing your settings due to the screen saver or suspend you could try cyberfish's screen saver, suspend/resume ''monitor_wacom'' C daemon.  It uses HAL monitor's notification of DBus.  Both it and Steven L. Seed's modification of ''monitor_wacom'' for hot plugging are posted on this [https://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=20110127060441.GA7826%40barra.i.followtheflow.org&forum_name=linuxwacom-devel linuxwacom-devel thread].

'''Note:''' the LWP does not support these work arounds.  The preference is for Desktops to integrate these functions.  No guarantees are made.

== Is hot plug supported for X intput devices? ==
See the LWP's [[FAQ#Is hot plugging supported for my USB tablet?|FAQ]]

A workaround for Xorg's that do not support hot plugging by Aristeu Rozanski's is ''wdaemon'' linked at the bottom of the [[Linuxwacom HOWTO#Hotplugging the device|Tablet Hotplugging]] section in the [[Linuxwacom HOWTO]].  Last development on it was 9/08 so later models aren't included.  This daemon is not supported by the LWP and no guarantees are made.

== Is my tablet supported? What about my special stylus? ==
Please see the [[FAQ#Which devices are supported?|Devices supported table]] on the LWP FAQ.  The Main page also contains a link to the table of all tablets that are known to be supported.

== Who is responsible for this code? ==
We are. That is, Linux users with Wacom tablets are responsible for the development of this code. John Joganic took up the code in November of 2002 and created this project. The source code was written by at least two dozen individuals, most of them are not directly involved in the project any more. I, Ping Cheng, have assumed the project administrator since 2003. What I ask of you, is to use the drivers and report the problems you encounter.

== Why does my cursor move randomly or stay at the top-left corner? ==
If you use a USB tablet, it is most probably because you didn't configure the X driver properly. Please refer to [[Linuxwacom HOWTO#Configuring X11|Configuring X11]] for solutions.

If it happens to a serial tablet, please post your problem at [https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/linuxwacom-discuss general discussion].
