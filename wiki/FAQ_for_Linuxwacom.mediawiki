{{Unclear|reason=Why do we have a separate page here? What's wrong with the [[FAQ]]?}}

'''This FAQ is intended only for questions relating to the linuxwacom drivers on legacy systems''' not dealt with by the LWP's [[FAQ]].  It is not intended to replace or duplicate '''the LWP's [[FAQ]].  Check there first''' for answers to your questions.

The Linuxwacom FAQ is based on the questions that we receive in email. If you have a question that is not answered here, send your email directly to the [[Main Page#Mailing lists|mailing list]].



== How do I get the special features of my stylus to work? ==
See the LWP's [[FAQ#How do I get the special features of my stylus to work?|FAQ]]

== Is hot plug supported for X intput devices? ==
See the LWP's [[FAQ#Is hot plugging supported for my USB tablet?|FAQ]]

== Is my tablet supported? What about my special stylus? ==
Please see the [[FAQ#Which devices are supported?|Devices supported table]] on the LWP FAQ.  The Main page also contains a link to the table of all tablets that are known to be supported.

Another workaround made by Aristeu is available at wdaemon. The email message related to this solution can be found at [[Linuxwacom HOWTO#Hotplugging the device|Tablet Hotplugging]].

== Who is responsible for this code? ==
We are. That is, Linux users with Wacom tablets are responsible for the development of this code. John Joganic took up the code in November of 2002 and created this project. The source code was written by at least two dozen individuals, most of them are not directly involved in the project any more. I, Ping Cheng, have assumed the project administrator since 2003. What I ask of you, is to use the drivers and report the problems you encounter.

== Why does my cursor move randomly or stay at the top-left corner? ==
If you use a USB tablet, it is most probably because you didn't configure the X driver properly. Please refer to Mouse1 for solutions.

If it happens to a serial tablet, please post your problem at [https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/linuxwacom-discuss general discussion].
