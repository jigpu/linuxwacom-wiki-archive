__TOC__
The wacom-kernel git repository is a recent reflection of the current [http://kernel.org/ linux kernel], and is intended to be used to assist Wacom kernel module development.  To check how closely synchronized wacom-kernel is with the '''mainline''' kernel select ''Gitweb'' to browse the kernel's git repository.

== wacom-kernel ==
The git repository is available to [http://linuxwacom.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=linuxwacom/wacom-kernel browse here].  It consists of 3 branches:  devel, master, and tested.

To clone the wacom-kernel git repository use:
<pre>
git clone git://linuxwacom.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/linuxwacom/wacom-kernel
</pre>

== Working with a Wacom Module ==
The devel branch is intended for working with the modules.  Use ''git checkout'' to select it:
<pre>
cd wacom-kernel
git checkout devel
</pre>
Depending on the module you wish to work with change to the appropriate directory.
*wacom.ko files:  wacom.h, wacom_sys.c, wacom_wac.c, wacom_wac.h
**in drivers/input/tablet
*hid-wacom.ko file:  hid-wacom.c
**in drivers/hid
*wacom_w8001.ko file:  wacom_w8001.c
**in drivers/input/touchscreen

Make your changes.  There is a Makefile in the wacom-kernel/wacom-kernel directory that makes it a bit easier to compile & install the wacom modules.  Change directory to /wacom-kernel and use:
<pre>
make modules
make install
</pre>

== Sample Workflow ==
A possible workflow could consist of the following:
# Make changes to the module code.
# Add the changed file with ''git add'' and sometimes do a ''git commit''.
# Then cd to wacom-kernel (use separate terminal for that) and ''make modules'' (might use the alternative ''make btmodules'' if working on hid-wacom).
# If the compilation goes OK do a ''make install'' from a separate terminal with root account. (could use ''make btinstall'' if you used ''make btmodules'' in 3).
# Now ''rmmod'' the new module and after restarting the tablet the new module is loaded.
# Test if the changes worked.

== Maintainer ==
The repository is maintained by Przemo Firszt.
