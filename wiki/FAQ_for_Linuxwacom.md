**This FAQ is intended only for questions relating to the linuxwacom
drivers on legacy systems** not dealt with by the LWP's
[FAQ](/wiki/FAQ "wikilink"). It is not intended to replace or duplicate **the
LWP's [FAQ](/wiki/FAQ "wikilink"). Check there first** for answers to your
questions.

The Linuxwacom FAQ is based on the questions that we receive in email.
If you have a question that is not answered here, send your email
directly to the [mailing list](/wiki/Main_Page#Mailing_lists "wikilink").

How do I get the special features of my stylus to work?
-------------------------------------------------------

See the LWP's
[FAQ](/wiki/FAQ#How_do_I_get_the_special_features_of_my_stylus_to_work? "wikilink")

Is hot plug supported for X intput devices?
-------------------------------------------

See the LWP's
[FAQ](/wiki/FAQ#Is_hot_plugging_supported_for_my_USB_tablet? "wikilink")

Is my tablet supported? What about my special stylus?
-----------------------------------------------------

The main page contains a list of all tablets that are known to be
supported. Tablets with "(beta)" appended are only supported in the beta
drivers at present.

Another workaround made by Aristeu is available at wdaemon. The email
message related to this solution can be found at [Tablet
Hotplugging](/wiki/Linuxwacom_HOWTO#Hotplugging_the_device "wikilink").

Who is responsible for this code?
---------------------------------

We are. That is, Linux users with Wacom tablets are responsible for the
development of this code. John Joganic took up the code in November of
2002 and created this project. The source code was written by at least
two dozen individuals, most of them are not directly involved in the
project any more. I, Ping Cheng, have assumed the project administrator
since 2003. What I ask of you, is to use the drivers and report the
problems you encounter.

Why does my cursor move randomly or stay at the top-left corner?
----------------------------------------------------------------

If you use a USB tablet, it is most probably because you didn't
configure the X driver properly. Please refer to Mouse1 for solutions.

If it happens to a serial tablet, please post your problem at [general
discussion](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/linuxwacom-discuss).
