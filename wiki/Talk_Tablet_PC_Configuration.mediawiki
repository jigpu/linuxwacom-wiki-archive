{{Unclear|reason=
* Having model-specific scripts like .xsetwacom.sh is a temporary hack and needs to be stated as such}}
Addressed with:  '''These are a temporary hack''' while we wait on a replacement for wacomcpl, see [[External applications#Graphical Configuration Tools|Graphical Configuration Tools]].

Addressed issues with:  The following scripts were authored by Favux.  Where co-developed with others they are cited in the relevant script.  All or almost all of the values are the defaults with the default stated and the appropriate range given.  The exception being the pad (tablet buttons).  Examples are shown of how to configure those for different uses in different applications.  The scripts are intended to provide you with a framework to configure your settings in a text file rather than at the command line, with similar results to what the wacomcpl gui would have produced.
