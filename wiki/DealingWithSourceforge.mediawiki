Sourceforge is a bit ... iffy. Here's a list of things you need to know
about our sourceforge account.


= Creating a shell =
The [https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/wiki/Shell%20service shell service] has the detailed instructions, but long story short: to log
onto sf via ssh, you need to create a shell for your username and the
project.

  ssh -t <user>,linuxwacom@shell.sourceforge.net create

Once the shell is created, it will exist for 4 hours unless closed earlier by the user.
Note that multiple logins in short succession can yield authentication errors. Simply waiting 30s between logins usually works around this.
