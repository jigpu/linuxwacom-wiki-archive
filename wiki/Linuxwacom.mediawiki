linuxwacom is a combined kernel + X driver package for X servers up to including 1.6. Note that the kernel patches provided here are backports, including new device support for kernels.
If you run a reasonably modern desktop distribution, you do not need the linuxwacom tarballs.

All linuxwacom-related pages are compiled in the [[:Category:Linuxwacom]].


== Download ==

Please download the latest release from the [https://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxwacom/files/ sourceforge download section]. linuxwacom provides two types of packages - stable and development versions.

== Building the code ==
In the following, you need to replace the version number with the one from your downloaded tarball.
<pre>
tar jxf linuxwacom-0.8.4-4.tar.bz2
cd linuxwacom-0.8.4-4
./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-wacom
make && sudo make install
</pre>

--enable-wacom enables the build of the wacom kernel driver. If you do not want to build it, simply leave out this flag. The prefix of /usr is correct on most distributions (unfortunately, the default is still /usr/local which isn't used widely anymore).

A more exhaustive description of the build process is avaiable in [[Building linuxwacom]].

== linuxwacom xdrv ==
The linuxwacom tarball includes an X driver for X servers up to including the 1.6.x series. For newer X servers, please use [[xf86-input-wacom]] instead, the linuxwacom X driver will not build.
Note that if you run a kernel that requires linuxwacom backports, you may still do so. Install the kernel patches provided in the tarball and the [[xf86-input-wacom]] X driver.
