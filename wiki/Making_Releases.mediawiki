This page describes how to do a new xf86-input-wacom release. VERSION stands for the new version (e.g. 0.10.3), OLDVERSION for the previous version (e.g. 0.10.2).

# Change configure.ac to reflect the new version number and commit: '''git commit -sm "wacom VERSION" configure.ac''' You ''must not'' have uncommitted changes when releasing a new version.
# Run '''autoreconf -iv''' or '''autogen.sh''', build and install the driver. Verify that the new version shows in the Xorg.log.
# Run '''make distcheck'''. Verify the name of the tarballs (xf86-input-wacom-VERSION.tar.bz2 and xf86-input-wacom-VERSION.tar.gz). If make distcheck fails, reset with '''git reset --hard HEAD~1''' and resolve the bugs first.
# Tag the module: '''git tag -m "xf86-input-wacom VERSION" -s xf86-input-wacom-VERSION
# Push to the remote: '''git push origin master'''
# Run the release script: '''sh release.sh'''. This script will push the tag and upload the tarballs to the remote.
# Type up a short announce email summarising the new features in this version and append the git shortlog: '''git shortlog xf86-input-wacom-OLDVERSION..xf86-input-wacom-VERSION'''
# '''Sign off the email''' and send it to the [[Mailing lists | linuxwacom-announce list]]

Note that it may take a while until the uploaded tarballs are available through the download links.
