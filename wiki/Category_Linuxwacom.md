This page compiles all information related to the
[linuxwacom](linuxwacom "wikilink") driver. Note that the
[linuxwacom](linuxwacom "wikilink") driver is a series of backports for
older kernels and X servers and is not part of any modern desktop
distribution. Where *modern* is defined as kernel 2.6.36 (or later) and
X.org X server 1.8 (or later).

<small>The exception being the **Debian/Ubuntu** kernel 2.6.35. Because
of their use of a *hybrid* X server 1.7 with it, they use the
xf86-input-wacom X driver wacom\_drv.so and the linuxwacom usb kernel
driver/module wacom.ko.</small>
