The '''input-wacom''' driver is the usb kernel driver/module paired with [[xf86-input-wacom]]. It backports new features and model support to kernels 2.6.26 through 2.6.36.  Those with kernels 2.6.37 or higher should use their distro supplied kernel drivers.

'''If you are developing support for new devices, do not use this package. Develop against upstream kernels instead.''' Patches in input-wacom may not find their way into upstream kernels. Any backported kernel driver features and model support should be submitted to the [https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-input/ linux-input mailing list].

== Getting the Source ==
Please download the latest release from the [https://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxwacom/files/xf86-input-wacom/input-wacom/ sourceforge download section] and unpack it with:

<pre>
tar xjvf input-wacom-<version number>.tar.bz2
cd input-wacom-<version number>
</pre>

Alternatively, pre-release code is available at the [http://linuxwacom.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=linuxwacom/input-wacom;a=summary input-wacom git repository].

<pre>
git clone git://linuxwacom.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/linuxwacom/input-wacom
cd input-wacom
</pre>

== Building the Driver ==
We provide a helper script ''autogen.sh'' that wraps the autotools steps. First make sure you have the following tools installed: gcc, automake, autoconf and make.
<pre>
./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib    # on 32 bit machines
./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib64  # on 64 bit machines
</pre>

== Installing the Driver ==
Follow the instructions provided at the end of the build to copy the kernel modules to your system's module directory. USB tablets rely on the <code>wacom.ko</code> kernel module, while most touchscreens will use the <code>wacom_w8001.ko</code> module:
<pre>
cp ./<kernel version>/wacom.ko /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/input/tablet/
cp ./<kernel version>/wacom_w8001.ko /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/input/touchscreen/
</pre>

After the modules have been copied, you will need to rebuild all of the module dependencies:
<pre>
depmod -a
</pre>

== X driver ==
Upgrading both the kernel driver and the X driver to the same version is recommended. Please see [[xf86-input-wacom]] for the X driver required for X servers 1.7 and later.
