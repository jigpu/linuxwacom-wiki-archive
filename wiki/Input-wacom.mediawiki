The '''input-wacom''' driver is a set of loadable kernel modules which allows new tablets to be used with systems using kernels as old as Linux 2.6.30. While this gets many of the updates that are pushed to the upstream Linux kernel driver, some differences may exist. This will be particularly apparent for users of older kernels. Because of this, we recommend upgrading your kernel if possible and only installing this driver when absolutely necessary.

This driver builds two separate kernel modules: [[wacom.ko]] and [[wacom_w8001.ko]]. The former is used for the vast majority of tablets (USB-attached for 2.6.30 - 3.16; USB/Bluetooth/I2C-attached for 3.17+), while the latter is used for older tablet PCs whose digitizers are connected via an internal serial interface. The [[hid-wacom.ko]] and [[wacom_i2c.ko]] modules (legacy modules for Bluetooth and I2C tablets, respectively) are ''not'' included with this driver.

== Installation ==
=== Prerequisites ===
Before building, you'll need to ensure the necessary dependencies have been installed on your system:

<code>
 sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) build-essential # on Debian, Ubuntu, Mint
 sudo yum install gcc kernel-devel               # on RHEL, CentOS, Fedora
</code>

=== Download ===
Please download the latest release from the [https://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxwacom/files/xf86-input-wacom/input-wacom/ sourceforge download section] and unpack it with:

<code>
 tar xjvf input-wacom-<version number>.tar.bz2
 cd input-wacom-<version number>
</code>

=== Build / Install ===
From within the extracted input-wacom directory, run the following commands to build the driver and install it where your system can find it:

<code>
 ./configure
 make
 sudo make install
 sudo depmod -a
</code>

Note: If installing from git, use ./autogen.sh instead of ./configure.

=== Module Loading ===
Finally, you'll need to have the module loaded by the kernel so that it can be used by the rest of the system. The easiest way to do this is to simply reboot; the kernel will automatically load the newly-installed module when necessary. Alternatively, you can use the commands below to force the running kernel to reload the module without rebooting:

<code>
 sudo modprobe -r wacom
 sudo modprobe -r wacom_w8001
 sudo insmod */wacom.ko
 sudo insmod */wacom_w8001.ko
</code>

== Development ==
'''If you are developing support for new devices, please develop against upstream kernels first.''' Patches in input-wacom may not find their way into upstream kernels. Once a device is supported upstream, feel free to submit patches for backported support to the [https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-input/ linux-input mailing list].

The input-wacom driver is available through git for developers to hack on. Before using it, you should install your distribution's '''git''', '''autoconf''', and '''automake''' tools. Afterwards, you may clone the repository as follows:

<code>
 git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/linuxwacom/input-wacom linuxwacom-input-wacom
 cd linuxwacom-input-wacom
</code>

Note that the '''configure''' script will not exist when building from git. We provide a helper ''autogen.sh'' script that wraps executing the autotools steps as well as executing the configure step. After running it, you can either install the modules as normal, or use insmod with the files directly in the build directory.

== X driver ==
Upgrading both the kernel driver and the X driver to the same version is recommended. Please see [[xf86-input-wacom]] for the X driver required for X servers 1.7 and later.
