The '''input-wacom''' driver is the usb kernel driver/module paired with [[xf86-input-wacom]]. It backports new features and model support to kernels 2.6.26 through 2.6.36.  Those with kernels 2.6.37 or higher should use their distro supplied kernel drivers.

'''If you are developing support for new devices, do not use this package. Develop against upstream kernels instead.''' Patches in input-wacom may not find their way into upstream kernels. Any backported kernel driver features and model support should be submitted to the [https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-input/ linux-input mailing list].

== Getting the Source ==
Please download the latest release from the [https://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxwacom/files/xf86-input-wacom/input-wacom/ sourceforge download section] and unpack it with:

<pre>
tar xjvf input-wacom-<version number>.tar.bz2
cd input-wacom-<version number>
</pre>

Alternatively, pre-release code is available at the [http://sourceforge.net/p/linuxwacom/input-wacom/ci/master/tree/ input-wacom git repository].

<pre>
git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/linuxwacom/input-wacom linuxwacom-input-wacom
cd linuxwacom-input-wacom
</pre>

== Building the Driver ==
When compiling from a released version of input-wacom, gcc needs to be installed as well as linux kernel development headers.  Examples of installing kernel headers for a couple of system types:
<pre>
apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)  # on Debian machines
yum install gcc kernel-devel               # on Fedora machines
</pre>
Configuring and compiling the input driver is accomplished with a single command.
<pre>
./configure
</pre>
If compiling from a git clone, the configure script will not exist and you will need autoconf and automake tools to be installed to generate the support files.  We provide a helper script ''autogen.sh'' that wraps executing the autotools steps as well as executing the configure step.
<pre>
./autogen.sh
</pre>

== Installing the Driver ==
Follow the instructions provided at the end of the build to copy the kernel modules to your system's module directory. USB tablets rely on the <code>wacom.ko</code> kernel module, while most touchscreens will use the <code>wacom_w8001.ko</code> module:
<pre>
cp ./<kernel version>/wacom.ko /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/input/tablet/
cp ./<kernel version>/wacom_w8001.ko /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/input/touchscreen/
</pre>

After the modules have been copied, you will need to rebuild all of the module dependencies:
<pre>
depmod -a
</pre>

== X driver ==
Upgrading both the kernel driver and the X driver to the same version is recommended. Please see [[xf86-input-wacom]] for the X driver required for X servers 1.7 and later.
